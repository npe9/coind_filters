Files sieve.v filter.v and sieve_arith_complements.v have been edited from the initial revision
to compile with coq-8.3pl1 and coq-8.4pl3

Just these three files should be enough to see the contents of the paper 

"Filters on coinductive streams, an application to Eratosthenes' sieve"

at work.

To run them, compile them in the following order:

filter.v
sieve_arith_complements.v
sieve.v
